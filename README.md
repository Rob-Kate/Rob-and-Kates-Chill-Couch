## >Planned List
- Button function for movie/show tiles
  - Quick button to activate a border saying if it's either planned, watched, paused on or shelved
  - Shows reviews once hovering
  - Displays artwork/still of the video source
  - When you press the play button at the bottom, it brings you to either a separate page showing more stuff (not an actual page, a "semi-fullscreen" GUI?) Idk, still planning this one out
  - When you hover over it, it exponentially increases its size but doesn't shift others (If you want, purely optional, code it so that the others shift to their respective side)
